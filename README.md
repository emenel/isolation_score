For a solitary performer.

1. Draw a floorplan of your home (from memory)

2. Number each room (don't forget utility rooms, bathrooms, closets, etc)

3. Following your numbered sequence, visit each room (one at a time) and do the following:
    - Start recording
    - When you become bored (or forget what you're doing), say the number of the room aloud
    - Record a little more
    - Stop recording, move to the next room

4. Splice together the recordings, in order of the initial sequence
