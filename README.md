# Numbered Rooms in Isolation
by Matt Nish-Lapidus
April 6, 2020

For a single performer, voice and recording device.

1. Draw a floorplan of your home (from memory)

2. Number each room (don't forget utility rooms, bathrooms, closets, etc)

3. Following your sequence, visit each room (one at a time) and do the following:
    - Record about 30 seconds of room tone
    - Say the number of the room aloud
    - Record about 30 seconds more of room tone
    - Stop recording, move to the next room

4. Splice together the recordings, in order of the initial sequence
